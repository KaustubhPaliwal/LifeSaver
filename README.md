# LifeSaver

LifeSaver is a Mixed Reality (MR) application designed for Meta Quest devices, aimed at providing guidance to individuals without medical expertise in assisting with emergency scenarios such as managing blood loss during crises like earthquakes.

## Features

- **Mixed Reality Experience**: Utilizes Meta XR SDK to blend virtual elements with real-world environments, enhancing realism and immersion.
  
- **Plane Tracking and Physics Simulation**: Simulates emergency scenarios using plane tracking and physics to replicate crisis situations realistically.
  
- **Hand Tracking and Gestures**: Enhances user interaction with intuitive hand tracking and gestures, mimicking real-world actions for seamless user experience.
  
- **Voice Commands with Contextual Adaptation**: Integrates Meta Voice SDK and Wit.ai for generating adaptive voice commands and instructions. Provides contextual guidance through menus and system controls, facilitating easy navigation.
  
- **Wayfinding for Medical Equipment**: Guides users step-by-step on how to use medical equipment effectively during emergency situations.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Meta XR SDK**: Provides tools for Mixed Reality development on Meta Quest devices.
  
- **Unity3D**: Game engine used for developing the Mixed Reality environment and interactions.
  
- **Blender**: Used for 3D modeling and creating assets for the application.
  
- **C#**: Programming language used for scripting within Unity3D.
  
- **Wit.ai**: Natural Language Processing tool for voice command recognition and adaptation.
